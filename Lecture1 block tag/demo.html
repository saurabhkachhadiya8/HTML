	<p>Two members of the 1984 class of Jefferson High School are chairing a group of 18 to look for a resort for the 20-year class reunion. A lovely place 78 miles from the city turns out to be the best. It has 254 rooms and a banquet hall to seat 378. It has been open 365 days per year since opening on May 30, 1926. They will need 450 to reserve the resort. Debbie Holmes was put in charge of buying 2,847 office machines for the entire firm. Debbie visited more than 109 companies in 35 states in 6 months. She will report to the board today in Room 2784 at 5 p.m. The board will consider her report about those 109 firms and recommend the top 2 or 3 brands to purchase. Debbie must decide before August 16. Lynn Greene said work started on the project March 27, 2003. The 246 blueprints were mailed to the office 18 days ago. The prints had to be 100 percent accurate before they were acceptable. The project should be finished by May 31, 2025. At that time there will be 47 new condominiums, each having at least 16 rooms. The building will be 25 stories.</p>
